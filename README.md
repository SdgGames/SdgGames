Hello, I am Matthew, and I'm making games that make a difference. All of my projects are open sourced, so feel free to check them out or contribute.

I primarily use [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sdggames), so feel free to check out my projects there!

You can keep up with my latest game developent over on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SDGGames), [SdgGameCollective.com](http://sdggamecollective.com/), or jump on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZZ3BP3abRg) to say Hi.
